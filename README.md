<h2>SAE Web Design and Development Diploma, creative (final) project.</h2> 

<p>It's a mock website for a community sports center, offering visitors the ability to book activities in the center. 

It was built to showcase the skills acquired throughout the whole course, and so it is custom made, without using any templates or libraries.

The backend is coded in PHP and MySQL, and the front end is pure HTML, CSS and Javascript (with just a bit of jQuery).

Features of the website include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Account creation with member's area</li>
  <li>Admin panel with overview of the activities and members, including ajax livesearch</li>
  <li>Custom made 5 day rolling booking system</li>
  <li>Javascript gallery</li>
  <li>Custom contact form</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a live example of the website <a href="https://gkokosis.tech/final/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
